SeConD: A Rich Text Security Conversation Dataset for Multi-Turn Response Selection

## Abstract
Most of the existing multi-turn conversation datasets are extracted from the chit-chat or short conversation, which is limited due to the lack of variety of the texts and annotation (e.g., emojis and step-by-step explanations can be barely found in existing datasets). Cybersecurity conversations provide users valuable tips and recommendations on how to take security measures against cyber attacks. We introduce a rich text cybersecurity corpus, namely SeConD (Security Conversation Dataset), which is a manually annotated dataset consisting of 148k English dialogues extracted from online cybersecurity forums. We provide benchmark performance of twelve state-of-the-art models trained on our dataset.
